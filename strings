# Print a simple string
print("Hello there")

# This prints out the phrase "Hello there" on one line.
# To print out the phrase on two separate lines, we use the \n function.

print("Hello \nthere")

# We can store stings in a variable. HINT: Think of a variable as a bucket where you can store stuff.
# Variable name has no quotation marks, but the object has them.
# The equal sign is the assignment operator.

hi = "hello there"
name = "Sam"
greet = hi + name
print(greet)

# To insert a blank space in thereSam
greet = hi + " " + name
print(greet)

# Capitalize all the letters in the string using "upper" funtion
print(greet.upper())

# Write all the letters in the string using "lower" function
print(greet.lower())

# To convert all letters in the string to UPPERCASE then confirm they are all UPPER CASE
print(greet.upper().isupper())

# To convert all letters in the string to lower case then confirm they are all lower case
print(greet.lower().islower())

# The length of a string can be determined using the "len" function.
# The variable greet now contains "hello there Sam" (all lower case)
# This is a total of 15 characters including the spaces.
print(len(greet))

# To locate the index of a specific letter, i.e its position in the phrase
# Note that the first letter in the string is indexed as 0
print(greet.index("h"))

# To locate the index of a phrase within the string
# the first letter encountered in the phrase has it's index number printed out
print(greet.index("there"))

# Letters from string can be printed using "[]" and their index.
print(greet[0])

# To replace a section of a matching string, we use the "replace" function.
print(greet.replace("Sam", "John"))

# Strings can be added in the print function (concatenation). Fancy word meaning 'add'
print(greet + ", how are you?")
