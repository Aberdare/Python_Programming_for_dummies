# We create lists by using []
# The individual elements which have '' are then inserted into this []
fruits = ["Apples", "Mangoes", "Bananas", "Pineapples", "Cherries", "Plums", "Avocados", "Peaches"]

print(fruits)

# The first element is indexed as 0, the second as 1, the third as 2, etc
# Print the first element in the list (apples)

# Print the third element in the list (bananas)

# To start from the eng counting backwards, the last element (peaches) is indexed as -1
