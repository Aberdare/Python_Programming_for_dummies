# Tuples are immutable, meaning that it's not possible to delete the items they contain.
# Tuples are preferably used where we have no intention of changing the data later in the code.
# List syntax
coordinates = [2, 19]
print(coordinates)

# Changing value of the first element
coordinates[1] = [31]
print(coordinates[1])

# Tuples syntax
coordinates = (2, 19)
print(coordinates)

# Changing value of the first element
# This line of code: coordinates[1] = [31] will return an error when the program is run.
print(coordinates[1])

# To construct a tuple with a single element, use a comma
random_number = (2,)
print(random_number)

# You can spread out the tuple elements over several lines without need for the "\" continuation character.
my_list = (1,
           2,
           3,
           4)

# Length of a tuple
